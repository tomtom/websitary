= 0.3

* Renamed the global option :downloadhtml to :download_html.
* The downloader for robots and rss enclosures should now be properly 
  configurable via the global options :download_robots and 
  :download_rss_enclosure (default: :openuri).
* Respect rel="nofollow" on hyperreferences.
* :wdays, :mdays didn't work.
* --exclude command line options, exclude configuration command
* Check for robots.txt-compliance after testing if the URL is 
  appropriate.
* htmldiff.rb can now also highlight differences à la websec's webdiff.
* configuration.rb: Ignore pubDate and certain other non-essential fields (tags 
  etc.) when constructing rss item IDs.


= 0.2.1

* Use URI.merge for constructing robots.txt uri.
* Fixed minor show-stopper.


= 0.2.0

* Renamed the project from websitiary to websitary (without the 
  additional "i")
* The default output filename is now constructed on basis of the profile 
  names joined with a comma.
* Apply rewrite-rules to URLs in text output.
* Set user-agent (:body_html)
* Exit with 1 if differences were found
* Command line options have slightly changed: -e now is the short form 
  for --execute
* Commands that can be triggered by the -e command-line switch: downdiff 
  (default), configuration (list currently configured urls), latest 
  (show the current version of all urls), review (show the latest 
  report)
* Protect against filenames being too long (max size can be configured 
  via: <tt>option :global, :filename_size => N</tt>)
* Try to migrate local copies from the older flat to the new 
  hierarchical cache layout
* Disabled -E/--edit, --review command-line options (use -e instead)
* Try to maintain file atime/mtime when copying/moving files
* FIX: Problem with loading robots.txt
* Respect meta tag: robots="nofollow" (noindex is only checked in 
  conjunction with :download => :website*)
* quicklist profile: register urls via the -eadd command-line switch; 
  see "Usage" for an example
* Temporaly save diffs, so that we can reuse them when websitary should 
  exit ungracefully.
* Renamed :inner_html to :body_html
* New shortcuts: :ftp, :ftp_recursive, :img, :rss, :opml (rudementary)
* New experimental commands: aggregate, show ... can be used to 
  periodically check for changes (e.g. of rss feeds) but to review these 
  changes only once in a while
* Experimental --timer command-line option to re-run websitary every X 
  seconds.
* The :rss differ has an option :rss_enclosure (true or directory name) 
  that will be used for automatically saving new enclosures (e.g. mp3 
  files in podcasts); in theory, one should thus be able to use 
  websitary as pod catcher etc.
* Cache mtimes in order to reduce disk access.
* Special profile "__END__": The section in the script file after the 
  __END__ line. This seems useful in some situations when employing a 
  single script.
* Don't follow javascript links.
* New date constraint for sources:
      :daily => true ... Once a day
      :days_of_month => BEGIN..END ... download URL only once per month 
      within this range of days.
      :days_of_week => BEGIN..END ... download URL only once per week 
      within this range of days.
      :months => N (calculated on basis of  the calendar month, not the 
      number of days)


== 0.1.0 / 2007-07-16
